Type of Communication for Live Chat:

The communication in a live chat application should be implemented using real-time communication protocols,
such as WebSocket. WebSocket allows for bidirectional communication between the server and clients in real 
time, which is essential for live chat applications. It provides low latency and efficient data transfer, 
making it suitable for instant messaging.
Additionally, we may need a secure communication protocol (e.g., HTTPS) to protect user data and privacy. 
Implementing end-to-end encryption could be crucial for sensitive conversations.
Consider using a message broker or queuing system for handling high message loads, ensuring scalability and 
reliability.
Real-time communication is essential for live chat applications to provide users with instant responses
and a seamless chat experience.

Identifying Bottlenecks:

Potential bottlenecks in a live chat application could include database performance (if not optimized), 
server load (especially during high traffic), and inefficient code in the chat processing logic.
Scaling and load balancing could also be potential bottlenecks if not properly configured.
Mitigation: Implement database optimizations, employ caching mechanisms, and ensure proper load balancing 
and scaling strategies to distribute traffic effectively. Regularly monitor system performance to identify 
and address bottlenecks as they arise.

Optimizing the Solution:

Optimize database queries by using indexing, caching, and database replication if necessary.
Implement horizontal scaling to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for serving static assets like images and scripts.
Implement connection pooling to handle database connections efficiently.
Use microservices architecture to isolate chat functionality for easier scaling and maintenance.
Implement message queuing systems to manage incoming and outgoing messages efficiently.


Workload balanse:

Divide tasks based on team members' strengths and expertise.
	- One junior developer can work on the communication with the Live Chat Application.
	- The second junior associate can work on the logic for requesting phone numbers and handling fraud checks.
	- The mid-level associate can work on the Knowledge Base integration, user session management, article 
			retrieval, and the main application logic.

Estimation 

Estimating project duration with 15 similar use cases depends on several factors, including the complexity
of the use cases, team expertise, and project scope.
Break down each use case into smaller tasks, estimate the time required for each task, and then sum up 
the estimates.Consider factors like testing, bug fixes, and deployment. Use historical data or past project 
experiences as a reference. Add buffer time for unforeseen issues. Accurate estimation ischallenging and 
may require iterative refinement as the project progresses. 
As a rough estimate, it might take one to two months to complete all aspects of the project, 
including testing and fine-tuning.
